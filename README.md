# Introduction to Robotics (2023-2024)
Introduction to Robotics Laboratory Homework is an integral part of the 3rd-year curriculum at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. These assignments encompass a wide range of elements, including comprehensive requirements, intricate implementation details, and code and image files.

  <summary><h3>Homework 1: RGB Led Controlled by Three Potentiometers</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Task requirements:</strong> Control each channel (red, green, and blue) of an RGB LED using three separate potentiometers.This control is achieved using digital electronics, where the Arduino reads the potentiometer values and then sends mapped values to control each of the pins linked to the LED.  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Components Used:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 RGB LED</li>
      <li>3 potentiometers</li>
      <li>wires and 3 resistors of 330Î© </li>
    </ul>

  <summary><h3>Homework 2: Elevator simulator wannabe</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Task requirements:</strong> This project involves creating a simulation of a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer. Each of the 3 LEDs is meant to correspond to one of the 3 floors, with the LED representing the current floor illuminating. Additionally, another LED signifies the elevator's operational status. It will blink while the elevator is in motion and remain steady when it is stationary.
    
The system also incorporates 3 buttons that simulate the call buttons from the 3 different floors. When one of these buttons is pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towards that floor after a brief delay of around 1-2 seconds. Furthermore, the buzzer should produce brief sounds in the following situations: when the elevator arrives at the desired floor (similar to a "cling" sound) and during the elevator doors closing and movement. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Components Used:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>4 LEDs</li>
      <li>3 buttons</li>
      <li>a buzzer</li>
      <li>wires and 5 resistors (4 of 330 Î© for every LED and 1 of 100 Î© for buzzer)</li>
    </ul>
