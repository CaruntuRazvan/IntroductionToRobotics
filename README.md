# Introduction to Robotics (2023-2024)
Introduction to Robotics Laboratory Homework is an integral part of the 3rd-year curriculum at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. These assignments encompass a wide range of elements, including comprehensive requirements, intricate implementation details, and code and image files.

  <summary><h3>Homework 1: RGB Led Controlled by Three Potentiometers</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Task requirements:</strong> Control each channel (red, green, and blue) of an RGB LED using three separate potentiometers.This control is achieved using digital electronics, where the Arduino reads the potentiometer values and then sends mapped values to control each of the pins linked to the LED.  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Components Used:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 RGB LED</li>
      <li>3 potentiometers</li>
      <li>wires and 3 resistors of 330Î© </li>
    </ul>

  <summary><h3>Homework 2: Elevator simulator wannabe</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Task requirements:</strong> This project involves creating a simulation of a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer. Each of the 3 LEDs is meant to correspond to one of the 3 floors, with the LED representing the current floor illuminating. Additionally, another LED (the red one) signifies the elevator's operational status. It will blink while the elevator is in motion and remain steady when it is stationary.
    
The system also incorporates 3 buttons that simulate the call buttons from the 3 different floors. When one of these buttons is pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towards that floor after a brief delay of around 1-2 seconds. Furthermore, the buzzer should produce brief sounds in the following situations: when the elevator arrives at the desired floor (similar to a "cling" sound) and during the elevator doors closing and movement. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Components Used:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>4 LEDs</li>
      <li>3 buttons</li>
      <li>a buzzer</li>
      <li>wires and 5 resistors (4 with a resistance of 330 Î©, one for each LED, and 1 with a resistance of 100 Î© for the buzzer)</li>
    </ul>

  <summary><h3>Homework 3: 7 Segment Display Drawing</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Task requirements:</strong> This project uses the joystick to control the segment's position and simulate "drawing" on the display. The transitions between segments should be natural, allowing them to move from their current positions to neighboring ones without passing through any "walls." The initial position should be set on the decimal point (DP). The current position will always blink, regardless of whether the segment is turned on or off. The user can use the joystick to navigate to neighboring positions, as described in the accompanying table for movement directions. A short press of the button will toggle the segment's state from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. A long press of the button will reset the entire display by turning off all segments and relocating the current position to the decimal point.
 </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Components Used:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>one 7-Segment Display</li>
      <li>one joystick</li>
      <li>wires and 8 resistors (with a resistance of 220Î© or 330Î©)</li>
    </ul>
